        <h1>This is the best motherfucking website.</h1><br>
          
           <p>Really, it is.</p><br>

        <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some<br>
             styling?</h2><br>

           <p>You &thinsp; probably &thinsp; build &thinsp; websites &thinsp; using &thinsp; vim &thinsp; and &thinsp; feeling &thinsp; hardcore. You &thinsp; think &thinsp; your &thinsp; 4.99KB<br> 
            motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link.<br> 
            You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p><br>

           <p><span class="ln">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p><br>

        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2><br>

           <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:</p>

         <ul>
              <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
              <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a hreh="https://www.google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
              <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
              <li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
              <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span class="pt">well, kind of</span></li>
              <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span class="pt">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span></li>
              <li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without<br> 
                looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>website</li>
              <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
              <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans"<span class="pt">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span></li>
              <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any<br> 
                other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
              <li>Doesn't include any tracking service <span class="pt">this website does, but hey, who cares</span></li>
              <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
              <li>Use some fucking <span class="colored">colors.</span></li>
              <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="bl">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="vl">violetish color</span><br> 
                when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
         </ul>

        <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2><br>

          <p>This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the guy <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">before him.</a></p><br>

          <p>Why?</p>
         
         <ul>
              <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be<br> 
                different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
              <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">gTLDs</a> available out there: .website</li>
              <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to do something cool too.</li>
              <li>It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?)</li>
              <li>It runs on <a href="https://www.nginx.com/welcome-to-nginx/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
              <li>It uses <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> /s</li>
              <li>It doesn't use a single media query <span class="pt">well, not really</span></li>
              <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is<br> 
                outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4230784/internet-explorer-help">the crap he uses</a> to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/">a much cooler browser</a></li>
              <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript<img src="js.png" width="15" height="15" alt"logo js/>, CSS3<img src="css3.png" width="15" height="15" alt"logo css/> and HTML5<img src="html5.png" width="15" height="15" alt"logo html/></li>
              <li>It supports<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
              <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the<br> 
                website more than once</li>
              <li>It uses <a href="https://matomo.org/">Piwik</a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
              <li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a></li>
              <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Accessible</a></li>
              <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
              <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you<br> 
                can and what you can't do:</li>              
         </ul>

           <p><span class="ti">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</span></p><br>

        <h2>Put even less contrast</h2><br>

          <p>Yeah, a <span class="gr">&#11035;#444</span> is cool but a <span class="gr">&#11035;#454545 is better.</span></p>

          <p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a motherfuckingwebsite.</p><br>

        <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2><br>

          <p><span class="tli">Remember, not&nbsp; everybody&nbsp; is&nbsp; blind, and not  everybody&nbsp; wants&nbsp; to&nbsp; read&nbsp; a&nbsp; fucking&nbsp; 2&nbsp; inches&nbsp; letter&nbsp; on&nbsp; a&nbsp; 27</span><br> 
            inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p><br>

        <h2>Put some pictures </h2><br>
           
           <p><img src="cat.jpg" width="350" height="240" alt"image" chat class="flottant"/><br>

           We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a<br> 
            motherfuckingwebsite so include some pictures to give a<br> 
            context.</p><br>

          <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should 
            make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p><br>

          <p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p><br><br>
          
          <p><span class="tl">A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</span></p><br>

        <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2><br>

          <p>But this doesn't mean you should load your motherfuckingwebsite with shitty animations, instead keep it<br> 
            simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p><br>

          <p><blockquote cite="motherfuckingwebsite.com"><span class="tk">&#8220; </span>  &thinsp;Good design is as little design as possible.</p>
          
          <p><span class="ct">-Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</span>
            </blockquote></p><br>

          <p>That's not entirely true, look at that motherfuckingwebsite. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p><br>

        <h2>Epilogue</h2><br>

          <p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite</a> and the <br>
            <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>.</p><br>
          
          <p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still thebestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check 'em out.</p><br>
          
          <p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" <span class="pti">Cit. needed</span></p><br>

        <h2>Author</h2><br>

          <p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can <a href="https://twitter.com/DenysVitali">be followed on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/">followed on GitHub</a> or contacted <a href="https://denv.it/">here, on his ultra-minimalist website</a></p><br>

        <h2>Resources</h2><br>
           <p>The cat picture was taken from the cool <a hre="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>. website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka<br> 
            Public Domain) content. The author is <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/1899441-1899441/">1899441 (seriously? His username looks like my PIN code!), the <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cat-pets-cat-s-eyes-mieze-dear-451377/">old<br> 
            picture</a> was by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/">aloiswohlfahrt</a>, but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute. You can <a href="https://github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdenysvitali%2Fthebestmotherfuckingwebsite%2Fissues%2Fnew">open an<br> 
            issue on GitHub</a> if you think that this decision goes against the rules of a good looking<br> 
            motherfuckingwebsite.</p><br>
